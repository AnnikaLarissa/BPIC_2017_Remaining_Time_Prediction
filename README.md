# Remaining Time Prediction on BPIC 2017
This is the repository for the course 2AMI20 Advanced Process Mining, where our team works on a predictor to predict the remaining time of a trace in the BPIC 2017 dataset given an arbitrary prefix.

## Usage
To run 1_exploration and 2_preprocessing you need to download the BPIC 2017 dataset and store it as `data/BPI_Challenge_2017.xes.gz`
